# Udacity - Deep Learning

âœ¨ This repo contains my projects and tutorials for my **Udacity - Deep Learning**. You can find my certificate [here](https://graduation.udacity.com/confirm/9JE55AA).

## Tutorials & Projects
### Introduction to Neural Networks
* [Gradient Descent](/gradient-descent): Learn how to implement gradient descent.

### Projects
* [Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns](/first-neural-network): Implement a neural network in NumPy to predict bike rentals.
* [Dog Breed Classifier](/dog-breed-classifier): Build a convolutional neural network with PyTorch to classify any image (even an image of a face) as a specific dog breed.
* [TV Script Generation](/tv-script-generation): Train a recurrent neural network to generate scripts in the style of dialogue from Seinfeld.
* [Face Generation](/face-generation): Use a DCGAN on the CelebA dataset to generate images of new and realistic human faces.
* [Teach a Quadcopter How to Fly](/flying-quadcopter): Design an agent to fly a quadcopter, and then train it using a reinforcement learning algorithm of your choice!
