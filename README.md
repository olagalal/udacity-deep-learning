# Udacity - Deep Learning

âœ¨ This repo contains my projects and tutorials for **Udacity - Deep Learning**. You can find my certificate [here](https://graduation.udacity.com/confirm/9JE55AA).

## Tutorials & Projects
### Introduction to Neural Networks
* [Gradient Descent](/gradient-descent): Learn how to implement gradient descent.
* [Student Admission](/student-admissions): Learn to apply gradient descent to predicting patterns in student admissions data.
* [Linear Regeression](/linear-regression): Work with data on the average life expectancy at birth and the average BMI for males across the world.
* [Sentiment Analysis with NumPy](/sentiment-network): [Andrew Trask](http://iamtrask.github.io/) leads me through building a sentiment analysis model, predicting if some text is positive or negative.
* [Student Admission with Keras](/student-admissions-keras): Build a neural network which analyzes the dataset of student admissions at UCLA that we've previously studied.
* [IMDB with Keras](/IMDB-keras): Analyze a dataset from IMDB and use it to predict the sentiment analysis of a review.
* [Intro to TensorFlow](/intro-to-tensorflow): Start building neural networks with Tensorflow.
* [Intro to TFLearn](/intro-to-tflearn): A couple introductions to a high-level library for building neural networks.

### Convolutional Neural Networks
* [Weight Initialization](/weight-initialization): Explore how initializing network weights affects performance.
* [Autoencoders](/autoencoder): Build models for image compression and de-noising, using feedforward and convolutional networks in PyTorch.

### Recurrent Neural Networks
* [Intro to Recurrent Networks (Character-wise RNN)](/intro-to-rnns): Recurrent neural networks are able to use information about the sequence of data, such as the sequence of characters in text.
* [Embeddings (Word2Vec)](/embeddings): Implement the Word2Vec model to find semantic representations of words for use in natural language processing.
* [Sentiment Analysis RNN](/sentiment-rnn): Implement a recurrent neural network that can predict if the text of a moview review is positive or negative.
* [Sequence to sequence](/seq2seq): Implement a sequence-to-sequence recurrent network.
* [Tensorboard](/tensorboard): LSTM network for generating new characters built using TensorFlow and trained on Leo Tolstoy's masterpiece. Use TensorBoard to visualize the network graph, as well as how parameters change through training.
* [Machine Translation](/language-translation): Train a sequence to sequence network for English to French translation (on a simple dataset)

### Generative Adversarial Networks
* [Generative Adversarial Network on MNIST](/gan-mnist): Train a simple generative adversarial network on the MNIST dataset.
* [Batch Normalization](/batch-norm): Learn how to improve training rates and network stability with batch normalizations.
* [Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN)](/dcgan-svhn): Implement a DCGAN to generate new images based on the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset.
* [Semi-supervised learning](/semi-supervised): Learn how to use GANs to do semi-supervised learning. Semi-supervised models are used when you only have a few labeled data points.

### Deep Reinforcement Learning
* [Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning)](/reinforcement): Implement a deep Q-learning network to play a simple game from OpenAI Gym.

### Projects
* [Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns](/first-neural-network): Implement a neural network in NumPy to predict bike rentals.
* [Dog Breed Classifier](/dog-breed-classifier): Build a convolutional neural network with PyTorch to classify any image (even an image of a face) as a specific dog breed.
* [TV Script Generation](/tv-script-generation): Train a recurrent neural network to generate scripts in the style of dialogue from Seinfeld.
* [Face Generation](/face-generation): Use a DCGAN on the CelebA dataset to generate images of new and realistic human faces.
* [Teach a Quadcopter How to Fly](/flying-quadcopter): Design an agent to fly a quadcopter, and then train it using a reinforcement learning algorithm of your choice!
